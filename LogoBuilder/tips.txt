To create new project you just need to select a logo.bin file and specify a project directory.
You can specify program language explicitly adding it's short name to command line, eg. "LogoBuilder en-US".
You can place update-binary or updater-script files to project directory, so the program will use them in update.zip creation.
After creating a project program will search for update-binary and updater-script files in its directory and copy them to the project directory for using in update.zip creation.\nThis feature can be used for program adaptation for a specific phone model or CWM version.
You don't need convert BMP or JPG images to PNG, you can just rename them to imgN.png (this feature is provided by the Image class from .NET framework).
By default program creates update.zip file, appropriated for ZP100 and ZP300 based on mtk6575. (it flashes /dev/logo)
Secret feature!\nYou can make a boot_logo file via this program. Just try drag an image file to the program.
